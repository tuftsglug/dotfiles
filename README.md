# Tufts LUG Dotfiles Repo

This repo is to help members of the Tufts Linux Users Group share their
configurations and take a look at the configs of others.

If you want to contribute, just fork the repo, create a new directory with your
username and then issue a pull request. We'll merge in any change so long as it
only touches the folder belonging to the user that issued the PR.
