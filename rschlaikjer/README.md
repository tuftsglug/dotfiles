## Awesome

![Screenshot](/rschlaikjer/awesome.png?raw=true "Awesome")

Awesome config based off the Zenburn theme. Has a number of handy widgets
(network, audio, battery, wattage, MPD) and some handy shortcuts. See rc.lua for
details. Has bindings for the XF86 function keys.

## Bash

Fairly typical prompt layout, but with a shortener on the pwd section to show
only the first letter of each directory leading up to the cwd. E.g.,

    ross@Beast:/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/bootloaders/atmega$

becomes

    ross@Beast:/u/s/a/h/a/b/atmega$

which saves an appreciable amount of real estate if you are often in deeply
nested folders.

## Conky

Has a couple of font and script dependencies, which are also present.

## Xresources

Contains a couple config lines for [RXVT](http://www.rxvt.org/), my preferred
terminal. Also has some similar settings for plain xterm.
